# keeper-app

A Keeper App, a clone of Google Keep, is a web application that allows users to create and manage notes using a simple and intuitive interface. The application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for building complex UI's by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components.

The application has a clean and minimalistic design, making it easy for users to quickly add and delete notes. Each note has a title, and a description, that can be chosen by the user.

The application allows users to create new notes by typing on the "New Note" and clicking the add button. Users can also delete notes by clicking on the DEL button in the note. 

The Keeper App is a simple and useful tool for anyone who wants to take quick notes and keep them organized. It's a clone of Google Keep and has all the basic features of the original app, but it's not connected to any Google account and does not have the same level of functionality. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a great option for users who just want a simple note-taking app.
